# Capabilities Provided

## Replay::EventSystem::AWSMQ

this is the portion of the configuration of Replay that chooses to use the 
AWS MQ event system and defines the parameters used for connecting to it.  
Use the AWSMQ mode of the EventSystem and this package will be utilized.  
Include the information about what is needed to connect to your AWS
instance inside the structure

```perl
  Replay->new (
        EventSystem => {
            Mode     => 'AWSMQ',
            awsIdentity => 'MY AWS IDENTITY', 
            mqService   => 'URL OF YOUR MQ SERVICE',
        },
  );
```
